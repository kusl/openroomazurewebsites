            <h2>Privacy aware, security conscious</h2>
            <p>Openroom Flask allows you to track what is important to you on the server-side
                without compromising on privacy and security on the client side.
                Openroom Flask will not include any third-party tracking code by default.
                What happens between you and your users stays between you and your users.
                Openroom Flask recommends Mozilla Firefox.
